\section{Cardinal arithmetic}

\begin{prop}
  Suppose $(B_n)_{n\in\N}$ is a countable sequence of pairwise disjoint
  countable sets.
  Then, the union of the sequence is also countable.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  We will construct an injection $g : B = \Union_{n\in\N} B_n \to \N$.
  Take arbitrary $a \in B$.
  Then it belongs to $B_i$ for exactly one $i \in \N$.
  Let $f_i : B_i \to \N$ be the bijection witnessing that $B_i$ is countable.
  Let $m = f_i(a)$.
  We define $g(a) = \pi_i^m$ where $\pi_i$ is the $i$\th{} prime number.
  (So $\pi_0 = 2$, $\pi_1$ = 3, and so on.)

  Now we claim that $g$ is injective.
  To see this, take arbitrary $g(a), g(b) \in g(B)$.
  Suppose $g(a) = g(b)$.
  We want to show that $a = b$.
  Note $g(a) = \pi_i^m$ for some $i$ and some $m$,
  and $g(b) = \pi_j^n$ for some $j$ and some $n$.
  \begin{description}
    \item[Case] $i \neq j$.
      Then we have reached a contradiction, by the definition of primality.
      Specifically, $\pi_i^x \neq \pi_j^y$ for any $i \neq j$ and $x, y > 0$.
      So this case is impossible.

    \item[Case] $i = j$.
      Then we have $\pi_i^m = \pi_i^n$.
      By the injectivity of the exponentiation, we deduce that $m = n$.
      Note that $m = f_i(a)$ and $m = n = f_i(b)$.
      So $f_i(a) = f_i(b)$.
      But $f_i$ is a bijection, so it is in particular injective.
      We deduce that $a = b$, as required.
  \end{description}

  Since there exists an injection from $B \to \N$,
  we have by definition that $|B| \leq |\N|$.
  However, $B$ must be infinite, as $B_0 \subset B$ and $B_0$ is countable,
  so $|\N| = |B_0| \leq |B| \leq |\N|$.
  We deduce that $|B| = |\N|$.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
  Suppose $A$ is a countably infinite set and $D \subseteq A$ is also
  countably infinite.
  Then we can't say much about the cardinality of $S = A \setminus D$.
  Of course, $|S| \leq |A|$; removing elements can't make the set bigger.
  However, take for example $A = \N$. If $D = \setof{\text{even numbers}}$,
  then $S$ is the odd numbers and is also infinite;
  but if $D = \setof{n \in \N | n > 1}$,
  then $S = \setof{0, 1}$ is finite.
\end{rem}

\section{Formal systems}

\newcommand{\vsys}{\mathbf{V}}

We define a first formal system $\vsys$, with a single axiom \textqd{P},
and a single inference rule $x \rewrite x1$.
