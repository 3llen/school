If I do majors math cs:

    required courses (54 credits ~ 18 courses):

        comp 206 - introduction to software systems (F14) (3) !
        comp 250 - introduction to computer science (F14) (3) !
        comp 251 - algorithms and data structures (W15) (3) !
        comp 273 - introduction to computer systems (W15) (3) !
        comp 302 - programming languages and paradigms (W15) (3) !
        comp 310 - operating systems (F15) (3) !
        comp 330 - theory of computation (F15) (3) !
        comp 360 - algorithm design (F15) (3) !
        math 222 - calculus 3 (CEGEP) !
        math 235 - algebra 1 (F14) (3) !
        math 236 - algebra 2 (W15) (3) !
        math 315 - ordinary differential equations (F15) (3) !
        math 318 - mathematical logic (F14) (3) !
        math 242 - (did honours, math 256) analysis 1 (F16) (3) !
        math 317 - numerical analysis (F17)
        math 323 - probability (W17) !
        math 340 - discrete structures 2 (W17) !

        Calculus 3 and comp 202 are skipped.
        Hence, the credit count here is 48, not 54.

        I believe that:
            * instead of cal 3, I get one additional _elective_.

        I know that:
            * instead of comp 202, I get one additional COMP complementary.

    complementary courses (18 credits ~ 6 courses -- actually 21 credits):

        3 math courses:

            math 248 - honours advanced calculus (F16) ! (does this count?)
            math 338 - history and philosophy of mathematics (F17)
            math 488 - set theory (W17) !

        4 computer science courses: (there's an extra due to skipping 202)

            comp 512 - distributed systems (F15) ! (4)
            comp 520 - compiler design (W16) ! (4)
            comp 621 - program analysis and transformation (F16) ! (4)

            Because each is 4-credits, they cover the full 12 credits required.

    electives (18 credits ~ 6 courses -- actually 21 credits):

        7 courses:

            comp 396 - computer science research project (F17) (3)
            comp 523 - language-based security (F17) (3)
            comp 525 - formal verification (W17) ! (3)
            comp 527 - logic and commputation (W16) ! (3)
            comp 531 - advanced theory of computation (W16) ! (3)
            hgen 396 - human genetics research project (W15) ! (3)

            Remains one three-credit elective to choose.
